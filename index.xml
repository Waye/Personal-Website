      <description>overall learning First of all, really appreciate the firm gave me the opportunity learning and working during the pandemic. It is a unique experience not only under the abnormal situation but also it is my first yearly long internship. After this, I will graduate and step into society.
What I learned from Moneris? Working for the Canada largest fintech company specialized in payment really widely opens my sight to a new area.</description>
