is Elastic-Search  Elasticsearch is document oriented, meaning that it stores entire objects or documents. It not only stores them, but also indexes the contents of each document in order to make them searchable. In Elasticsearch, you index, search, sort, and filter documents—​not rows of columnar data. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about data and is one of the reasons Elasticsearch can perform complex full-text search. The act of storing data in Elasticsearch is called indexing.","tags":["Search","JS","SQL","SickKids"],"title":"ElasticSearch+Redis for general text search","type":"post","url":"/2021/08/01/SickKids-Tech-ElasticSearch/","weight":0,"wordcount":89},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1627776000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://weiyi-hu.com/tags/js/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/js/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"JS","type":"tags","url":"/tags/js/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1627776000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://weiyi-hu.com/tags/search/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/search/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Search","type":"tags","url":"/tags/search/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1627333500,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1627333500,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://weiyi-hu.com/tags/apache-kafka/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/apache-kafka/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Apache Kafka","type":"tags","url":"/tags/apache-kafka/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1627333500,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1627333500,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://weiyi-hu.com/tags/java/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/java/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Java","type":"tags","url":"/tags/java/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":["Learn"],"content":"Learning notes and codes are from Stephane Maarek's courses","date":1627333500,"description":"Learning notes and codes are from Stephane Maarek's courses","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"Learning notes and codes are from Stephane Maarek's courses","excerpt_text":"Learning notes and codes are from Stephane Maarek's courses","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"Learning notes and codes are from Stephane Maarek's courses","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627333500,"objectID":"00f26bf4676c69dec38bf90a75e0d3b8","permalink":"https://weiyi-hu.com/2021/07/26/Apache-Kafka-Review/","publishdate":"2021-07-26T21:05:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2021/07/26/Apache-Kafka-Review/","section":"post","summary":"Kafka Brief Intro  Youtube  Fundamental Kafka Theory =\u0026gt;:send to\n data sources =\u0026gt;topics =\u0026gt; partition =\u0026gt; offsets  data is randomly sent to the partition unless the key is provided   brokers and topics  kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers(servers) broker contains topics' partitions connect to any broker, then connect to whole cluster   topics replication  if one broker is down, another broker can serve the data.","tags":["Java","Apache Kafka","Search"],"title":"Java Apache Kafak Study","type":"post","url":"/2021/07/26/Apache-Kafka-Review/","weight":0,"wordcount":365},{"author":null,"categories":["Learn"],"content":"This blog gives a brief intro of my daily life as an intern at Moneris and some interesting projects I have been working on","date":1625179860,"description":"This blog gives a brief intro of my daily life as an intern at Moneris and some interesting projects I have been working on","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"This blog gives a brief intro of my daily life as an intern at Moneris and some interesting projects I have been working on","excerpt_text":"This blog gives a brief intro of my daily life as an intern at Moneris and some interesting projects I have been working on","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":800,"html":"This blog gives a brief intro of my daily life as an intern at Moneris and some interesting projects I have been working on","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625179860,"objectID":"de3a94c8870d22b40e897b5210d074cb","permalink":"https://weiyi-hu.com/2021/07/01/my-intern-at-moneris/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T22:51:00Z","readingtime":4,"relpermalink":"/2021/07/01/my-intern-at-moneris/","section":"post","summary":"overall learning First of all, really appreciate the firm gave me the opportunity learning and working during the pandemic.
